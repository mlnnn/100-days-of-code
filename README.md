# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Spent an hour going though the Passenger Counter project. Revisited Scrimba's JS module to make notes and recode everything to understand the material better, so I can peacefully move on with next projects. 

**Thoughts:** I can see how much I've improved since the first time I did that: I type much faster (as English is not my first language), I get stuff easier, come up with different solutions. Overall, it's pleasant. 

### Day 2: February 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Essentially, I've been doing the same stuff as on the day 1 (about 2 hours spent). But I got some help from GPT AI to understand the core principles better. Worked like a charm.

**Thoughts:** Fascinating. Went down a rabbit hole a bit with The DOM method and references. Did't get the latter AT ALL at first. It was so interesting to get to know about it, not even exaggerating. But now I get it! When we create a complex data type (an object, array, function), we're actually creating a reference to a location in memory where it's stored. We can then use that reference to access and manipulate the values stored. And on the other hand, more primitive data types (strings, numbers, and booleans) are passed by value, rather than by reference. 

Feeling like a child exploring the world for the first time, my motivation to keep learning is huge! But I have to go soon. See ya later!

### Day 3: February 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 2 hours done! Did the same thing as usual, today finishing the Passenger Counter project and the challanges!

**Thoughts:** I wasn't THAT excited as 2 days ago, honestly. a little depressed. Pushed through

### Day 4: February 22, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 2 hours done! Started Black Jack game project, made notes. 

**Thoughts:** It's funny how I always have an interval of 2 days lol. Well, I was in a bad place today (physically and mentally), was difficult to concentrate. Pushed through. 

### Day 5: February 23, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 2 hours again! Continued doing Black Jack, relearned about arrays, ways to modify them, made notes, started relearing loops :P

**Thoughts:** I was being distracted a lot, so kinda slowed my progress. I think it's important that I'm showing up more often and doing what I can at least in the current circumstances, building the habiit. Also! Got to spend some time with the person I'm inspired by, so it adds to my motivation bit by bit. I'll be back!

### Day 6: February 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: TADUDUM! 5 HOURS DONE! I finihed Black Jack game project, where revisited array modifyers (push/pop, shift/unshift, splice/slice), loops, Math methods to generate pseudo random numbers, operators AND (&&) and OR (||) and objects.

**Thoughts:** I didn't even get THAT tired. Immensly proud of myself. Of course, I don't expect to have the same level of performance even 3 times 
 a week, it's gonna be a very spiky graph. But I'm clearly ONTO something. Satisfied! (also, got an idea how to fix my previous mini project)
 
 ### Day 7: February 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 2 hours done! Would have done more if i didn't run out of the challanges, now I'm working on a password generator, its design.

**Thoughts:** It was fun, it's so cool...to understand what I'm actually writing. Make my own solutions, try out different onse. My progress in designing so far:

### Day 8: February 26, 2023

**Today's Progress**: (~1.5 hours done) I've finished my design and started coding it. Struggled a lot evenn with basic stuff. UGhh.

**Thoughts:** Decided to get some rest and continue the next day. My design:

### Day 9: February 28, 2023

**Today's Progress**: A bazillion hours done. But I'll write it down as 2 hours. Fixed my design to fit properly. (it was gigantic), started coding out the actual app. figured i'd need flexbox (AND I DON'T KNOW HOW TO USE IT). Started playing the flexbox game about fighting zombies with flexbox (fun) https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/

**Thoughts:** It was tiring and frustrating. But the game was fun.

### Day 10: March 1, 2023

**Today's Progress**: I'll write it down as 1 solid hour. Coded out a tiny bit of the project.

**Thoughts:** Eh, I had a REALLY bad day. Didn't have much strength and it's almost embarassing how long it took me to make a small change. I figured it's not the time for flexbox yet. I don't have much experience with it to use it in a project yet, it just does't look the way I want it to. Si this will have to wait. For now, I'm just using plain margin.

### Day 11: March 2, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Again, lots of guess work and try and fail situations today, so I won't log down the actual time spent. Let's put it as 1 hour. Kept correcting the spacing of elemets in the project, TRIED AND FAILED to make a checkbox (i hate them now).

**Thoughts:** Nothing much to add. Except that I removed all the margins and used positioning instead. My progress:

### Day 12: March 7, 2023

**Today's Progress**: ~2 hours done. Tried to learn how to make custom checkboxes. Why are they so unnecessarily diffucult to make? Bruh. Coded out a bit of HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** Felt really bad today, still I did something. My progress:

### Day 13: March 14, 2023

**Today's Progress**: ~2 hours done. Added checkboxes, up and down thingies with a bit of animation for password length, hover effects for buttons and rusult spaces, added gif and fixed minor things.

**Thoughts:** Apparently, checkboxes are not that beginner-friendly, who woulda thought lol. I used generator to help me with them. I think I'll finish with css tomorrow and start coding with JS. Check out my progress in the video below:

### Day 14: March 29, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 1 hour done. A bit of added elements and slight improvements for HTML and CSS.

**Thoughts:** HIHI! I've been absent for the longest time, been dealing with something that made me really discouraged. Anyway, getting back into it! Didn't do too much, and honestly, felt cranky as I have't coded for while. But I'll try to get condistent again!

lookin good, innit? 
BUT BUT BUT I've encountered the freakiest bug that I have no idea how to fix. There's a stray "/div", which should do nothing for the structure, but if removed, messes up CSS badly. Though, when I inspect the code in browser, there's no sight of that "/div", meaning browsers ignore it. Annoying.
But well, what can I do. I'll deal with this later.

Honestly, I'm so sick of HTML and CSS now. This project was meant to be JS focused, but I decided to get CreAtiVe and spent weeks on my messy styling UGH. 
Maybe a I chose a too complicated design? Like I can't unmess it for now, hope to be knowlegable enough to do that in future.
About JS, I chose to make customized checkboxes, so I don't really know how to navigate them? and incorporate in JS. 
also, i did a customized kinda input block? where you change the length of the password? i need to cap it to 8 and 15. aw......
anyway, that was just me ranting, see you later!

### Day 12: April 4, 2023
