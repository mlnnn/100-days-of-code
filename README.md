# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Spent an hour going though the Passenger Counter project. Revisited Scrimba's JS module to make notes and recode everything to understand the material better, so I can peacefully move on with next projects. 

**Thoughts:** I can see how much I've improved since the first time I did that: I type much faster (as English is not my first language), I get stuff easier, come up with different solutions. Overall, it's pleasant. 

### Day 2: February 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Essentially, I've been doing the same stuff as on the day 1 (about 2 hours spent). But I got some help from GPT AI to understand the core principles better. Worked like a charm.

**Thoughts:** Fascinating. Went down a rabbit hole a bit with The DOM method and references. Did't get the latter AT ALL at first. It was so interesting to get to know about it, not even exaggerating. But now I get it! When we create a complex data type (an object, array, function), we're actually creating a reference to a location in memory where it's stored. We can then use that reference to access and manipulate the values stored. And on the other hand, more primitive data types (strings, numbers, and booleans) are passed by value, rather than by reference. 

Feeling like a child exploring the world for the first time, my motivation to keep learning is huge! But I have to go soon. See ya later!

### Day 3: February 20, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 2 hours done! Did the same thing as usual, today finishing the Passenger Counter project and the challanges!

**Thoughts:** I wasn't THAT excited as 2 days ago, honestly. a little depressed. Pushed through

### Day 4: February 22, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 2 hours done! Started Black Jack game project, made notes. 

**Thoughts:** It's funny how I always have an interval of 2 days lol. Well, I was in a bad place today (physically and mentally), was difficult to concentrate. Pushed through. 

### Day 5: February 23, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 2 hours again! Continued doing Black Jack, relearned about arrays, ways to modify them, made notes, started relearing loops :P

**Thoughts:** I was being distracted a lot, so kinda slowed my progress. I think it's important that I'm showing up more often and doing what I can at least in the current circumstances, building the habiit. Also! Got to spend some time with the person I'm inspired by, so it adds to my motivation bit by bit. I'll be back!

### Day 6: February 24, 2023

**Today's Progress**: TADUDUM! 5 HOURS DONE! I finihed Black Jack game project, where revisited array modifyers (push/pop, shift/unshift, splice/slice), loops, Math methods to generate pseudo random numbers, operators AND (&&) and OR (||) and objects.

**Thoughts:** I didn't even get THAT tired. Immensly proud of myself. Of course, I don't expect to have the same level of performance even 3 times 
 a week, it's gonna be a very spiky graph. But I'm clearly ONTO something. Satisfied! (also, got an idea how to fix my previous mini project)
 
 ### Day 7: February 25, 2023

**Today's Progress**: 2 hours done! Would have done more if i didn't run out of the challanges, now I'm working on a password generator, its design.

**Thoughts:** It was fun, it's so cool...to understand what I'm actually writing. Make my own solutions, try out different onse. My progress in designing so far:

### Day 8: February 26, 2023

**Today's Progress**: (~1.5 hours done) I've finished my design and started coding it. Struggled a lot evenn with basic stuff. UGhh.

**Thoughts:** Decided to get some rest and continue the next day. My design:
