# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Spent an hour going though the Passenger Counter project. Revisited Scrimba's JS module to make notes and recode everything to understand the material better, so I can peacefully move on with next projects. 
**Thoughts:** I can see how much I've improved since the first time I did that: I type much faster (as English is not my first language), I get stuff easier, come up with different solutions. Overall, it's pleasant.
