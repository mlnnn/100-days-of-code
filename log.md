# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 16, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Spent an hour going though the Passenger Counter project. Revisited Scrimba's JS module to make notes and recode everything to understand the material better, so I can peacefully move on with next projects. 

**Thoughts:** I can see how much I've improved since the first time I did that: I type much faster (as English is not my first language), I get stuff easier, come up with different solutions. Overall, it's pleasant. 

### Day 2: February 18, 2023

**Today's Progress**: Essentially, I've been doing the same stuff as on the day 1 (about 2 hours spent). But I got some help from GPT AI to understand the core principles better. Worked like a charm.

**Thoughts:** Fascinating. Went down a rabbit hole a bit with The DOM method and references. Did't get the latter AT ALL at first. It was so interesting to get to know about it, not even exaggerating. But now I get it! When we create a complex data type (an object, array, function), we're actually creating a reference to a location in memory where it's stored. We can then use that reference to access and manipulate the values stored. And on the other hand, more primitive data types (strings, numbers, and booleans) are passed by value, rather than by reference. 

Feeling like a child exploring the world for the first time, my motivation to keep learning is huge! But I have to go soon. See ya later!
